# BofaD – Private Crypto Portfolio Tracker

**BofaD** is a fast, lightweight crypto portfolio tracker built for people who value **privacy and control**.

Manually enter your crypto holdings — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and more — and BofaD will show you the **current total value** of your portfolio, live from CoinGecko.

No sign-ups. No ads. No analytics. No cloud. Your data is stored **100% locally** on your device and never leaves it.

You do **not** need to connect your wallet or link any crypto addresses. BofaD is completely offline — it’s not tied to your real holdings in any way.
