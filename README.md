# Bofad – Private Crypto Portfolio Tracker

BofaD is a fast, lightweight crypto portfolio tracker built for people who value privacy and control.

Manually enter your crypto holdings — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and more — and BofaD will show you the current total value of your portfolio, live from CoinGecko.

No sign-ups. No ads. No analytics. No cloud. Your data is stored 100% locally on your device and never leaves it.

You do not need to connect your wallet or link any crypto addresses. BofaD is completely offline — it’s not tied to your real holdings in any way.
 Key Features:

    Track the total USD value of all your crypto assets

    Supports any CoinGecko listed token via symbol lookup (e.g. BTC, ETH, XMR)

    Local-only storage — nothing is sent or synced online

    No wallet linking or account setup required

    See how each token’s value has changed since you last updated its amount

    Fully private: no tracking, no ads, no user data collected

    Clean design with light & dark mode support

Whether you're a casual HODLer or a privacy-first investor, BofaD helps you stay on top of your holdings — without the bloat, noise, or surveillance of other apps.

 Note: BofaD is not intended to replace advanced portfolio or trading tools. It’s a lightweight, private supplement — ideal for quickly and discreetly checking your portfolio’s value and general trends on the go.

 Price data and token info powered by CoinGecko.
 BofaD does not offer trading, wallet access, financial advice, or online sync.

 We're continuing to improve BofaD with new features while keeping it fast, simple, and fully local.
